   A Software Engineer with over four years of experience in all phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. I specialize in designing and implementing web-based enterprise applications using Java/J2EE technologies and have a strong proficiency in cloud infrastructure, particularly with AWS services like S3, SQS, SES, and Lambda. 
    
    My recent role at MetLife involved optimizing RESTful APIs and automating workflows, which led to a 25% reduction in data retrieval times and a 50% faster deployment cycle. Previously, at ADP, I developed scalable enterprise services and integrated efficient CI/CD pipelines, resulting in significant improvements in platform responsiveness and deployment time. 
    
    I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Fitchburg State University and bring a comprehensive skill set in frameworks like Spring Boot, React.JS, and tools such as Docker, Jenkins, and Kubernetes. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to streamline processes and enhance system performance.
